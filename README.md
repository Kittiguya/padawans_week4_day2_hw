I LIKE README. THEYRE SO COOL. 
I completely snubbed adding an amount of tickets purchased to this database. My mind broke trying to do it. YIKES.
Regardless, i have a somewhat okay understanding of SQL and i hope this shows it. 
So far, for the amount in ticket that i wanted, the easiest way to explain what i wanted is:
think of a subway system with multiple subways in it, all traversing the same paths. 
They all connect along the same path, they all go the same route, but they adovacate for different parts of the system. 
Different schedules would allow the different subways to all go to the same routes without missing a beat.

Thats what i tried to do with amount of tickets. I was gonna pull the amount of viewings per customer id and convert it to tickets based on the amount sold during the purchase. 
But somehow i couldnt get the movie amount tracked in my database, to where i could pull it into a bridged connection for ticket to have an amount == amount for the movie.
